#color-picker

##What is color-picker?
Color-picker is a simple application designed to assist with selecting text
colors.

##Why did you write color-picker?
In some places, such as HTML, XML, or configuration files, you have to specify
colors as hex strings. It's a bit hard to imagine what color a hex string is,
so I wrote a graphical program to help.

##Why not just use Photoshop/GIMP/Illustrator/Inkscape/etc?
These are general-purpose image editing programs, and as such they have way
more functionality than is needed just to select text colors. In addition,
their general-purpose design makes it a bit cumbersome for the use of
selecting text colors, with a lot of menu-diving and mouse clicking.
